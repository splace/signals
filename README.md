# signals

Package signals generates and manipulates signals.
signals here are as:- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing"
where they "convey information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon"
here, more specifically, "any quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space"
currently this package supports only 1-Dimensionsal variation.
and for simplicity terminolology used represents analogy variation in time.
this package is intended to be general, and so a base package for import, and used then with specific real-world quantities.
