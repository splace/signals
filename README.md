# signals

generates and manipulates signals:- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing.

signals are entirely procedural.

where they "convey information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon"
here, more specifically, "any quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space".

currently this package supports only 1-Dimensionsal variation.

and for simplicity terminolology used represents analogue variation in time.

this package is intended to be general, and so a base package for import, and used then with specific real-world quantities.
